## Agile Planning:

**Sprint** 1 – For this sprint, our team will focus on setting up the environment and deciding what we will do for our sprints. We will also create a technical document, and the requirements for our first deadline.

**Sprint** 2 – For this sprint, we want to design how our website will look, setup the database, and try to get a small prototype working. For now, we won't be focusing too much on the design, as long as the website is working as it should, or close to how it should be working.

**Sprint** 3 – TBD once we finish sprint 2.
